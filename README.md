# Useful Python Scripts

- This repository contains scripts that i made as a solutions for D2D tasks people told me about and asked if i can help them make it 100% automated or partly.
- It might also contain some nonsense scripts that i made as part of exploration or a sudden need.
- Don't expect the scripts to be so agnostic as they were made for vey specific purpose or were part of a quick PoC.
